threejs-starter-kit
===================

Three.js starter kit made for Three.js Workshop.  
It uses Three.js, Greensock and Jquery as depencies.  
I also added a few Three.js extra classes from the examples for post-processing.  

After cloning install all node dependencies :  
`npm i`

Then install the libraries :  
`bower install`

Then launch gulp to build :  
`gulp`

You are good to go !
